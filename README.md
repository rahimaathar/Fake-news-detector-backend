# Fake News Detector Backend

Welcome to **Fake News Detector Backend** – a Python-powered machine learning backend designed to analyze and detect fake news articles with high accuracy!

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the server-side implementation of a fake news detection system. Built with Python and Flask, it leverages machine learning to analyze news articles and provide authenticity predictions. The system uses a pre-trained model to classify news articles as either real or fake.

## ✨ Features

- Machine learning-based fake news detection
- RESTful API endpoints for frontend integration
- Pre-trained model with high accuracy
- Real-time text analysis
- Logging system for monitoring and debugging
- Easy model retraining capabilities
- Support for batch processing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Web Framework:** Flask
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn
- **Data Processing:** pandas, numpy
- **Model Storage:** pickle
- **API Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detector.git
cd fake-news-detector/backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# Using the start script
./start.sh

# Or directly with Python
python app.py
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## 📚 Usage

### API Endpoints

1. **Analyze News Article**
   ```bash
   POST /api/analyze
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "text": "Your news article text here"
   }
   ```

2. **Batch Analysis**
   ```bash
   POST /api/batch-analyze
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "articles": ["article1", "article2", ...]
   }
   ```

### Retraining the Model

To retrain the model with new data:

```bash
python train_model.py
```
